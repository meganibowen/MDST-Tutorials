Introduce yourself in this file!

Tell us your name, year, school, major (if you are undecided, write down the frontrunners), and a fun fact!

Hi! I'm Megan and I'm a freshman in LSA. My. major is undecided but I'm planning on doing data science or econ (or both!). A fun fact about me is that before coming to college I swam competitively for 10 years.
